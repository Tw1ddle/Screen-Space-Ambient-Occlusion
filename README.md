# Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
WORK IN PROGRESS

Configurable screen space ambient occlusion algorithms for three.js/WebGL. Try it out now [in your browser](TODO).

Currently there is just one SSAO shader, based on shaders by [ArKano22](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/550699-ssao-no-halo-artifacts/) and [Martins Upitis](http://devlog-martinsh.blogspot.tw/).

Future efforts might include trying to implement Scalable Ambient Obscurance algorithms by Morgan McGuire et al.

## Notes
* Uses the three.js, stats.js and dat.gui JavaScript libraries.
* Uses the msignal and Sure haxelibs.
