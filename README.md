## Notes
* The current shader is based on the implementations by [ArKano22](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/550699-ssao-no-halo-artifacts/) and [Martins Upitis](http://devlog-martinsh.blogspot.tw/).
* In the future I will look into other solutions, such as techniques by [McGuire et al](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/papers/SAOHPG12/).
* Uses the three.js, stats.js and dat.gui JavaScript libraries.
* Depends on the msignal and Sure haxelibs.
